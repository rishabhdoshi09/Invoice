## Critical Updates (February 16, 2026 - Latest)

### ✅ Smart Application Enhancement Complete

**User Request:** "Enhance this whole application to have some smart (advance) features keeping in mind of all the mappings. I don't want unnecessary duplicates - just simple yet powerful, aesthetic and powerful that does all the job for us."

**New Features Implemented:**

   - Universal search bar in header - search orders, customers, suppliers instantly
   - Keyboard navigation (↑↓ to navigate, Enter to select, Esc to close)
   - Results grouped by type with relevant info (balance, status, phone)
   - File: `/app/frontend/src/components/common/GlobalSearch.jsx`

2. **Smart Dashboard (`/admin-dashboard`)**

   - Data Integrity Panel: Shows "All Good" when data is properly linked
   - Quick Actions: New Sale, Receive Payment, Make Payment, Add Purchase
   - Recent Sales with proper customer linking indicators
   - File: `/app/frontend/src/components/admin/dashboard/AdminDashboard.jsx`

**Test Report:** `/app/test_reports/iteration_9.json`

### RESOLVED: Customer/Supplier Mapping Issues

**Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ Credit sales not linking to customers - `customerId` was being set AFTER order creation
2. ✅ Supplier payments not creating suppliers - payments were orphaned with just `partyName`
3. ✅ Orders missing from customer details - legacy orders only had `customerName`, no `customerId`

**Backend Fixes:**
1. **Order Controller** (`/app/backend/src/controller/order.js`):
   - Moved customer creation/lookup BEFORE order creation
   - `customerId` now properly saved with the order
   - Added console logging for debugging

2. **Payment Controller** (`/app/backend/src/controller/payment.js`):
   - Auto-creates supplier if paying to new supplier name
   - Links payment to supplier via `partyId`
   - Updates supplier balance on payment

3. **Customer DAO** (`/app/backend/src/dao/customer.js`):
   - Now matches orders by `customerId` OR `customerName` (for legacy data)
   - Properly calculates balance from linked orders

**SQL Migrations Created:**
- `/app/backend/migrations/fix_order_customer_linking.sql` - Links orders to customers by name
- `/app/backend/migrations/fix_supplier_payments_linking.sql` - Creates suppliers from orphaned payments

### NEW: Advanced Supplier Ledger UI

**Smart Features Added to `/suppliers` page:**

1. **Quick Entry Tabs (No Dialogs):**
   - Tab 1: Add Supplier - Name, Mobile, GSTIN, Opening Balance
   - Tab 2: Quick Payment - With "Create New Supplier" toggle
   - Tab 3: Quick Purchase - With "Create New Supplier" toggle
   - Tab 4: Recent Activity - Shows last 5 payments

2. **Duplicate Detection:**
   - Warns when adding supplier with existing name
   - Shows existing supplier's balance

3. **Smart Payment Features:**
   - Auto-fills amount with due balance when supplier selected
   - "Pay Full" button for quick full payment
   - Shows advance/overpaid status

4. **Quick Actions from Table:**
   - Click PAY icon → Opens payment tab with supplier pre-selected
   - Click PURCHASE icon → Opens purchase tab with supplier pre-selected

5. **Clickable Summary Cards:**
   - Click "Total Payable" → Filters to suppliers with due
   - Click "Advance Given" → Filters to suppliers with advance
   - Click "Total Suppliers" → Shows all

6. **Inline Supplier Creation:**
   - Toggle to create new supplier while making payment/purchase
   - No need to add supplier first

## Critical Updates (February 13, 2026)

### P0 RESOLVED: Bill Number Made Optional
**Issue:** Bill Number field was mandatory when creating a purchase bill, but users wanted flexibility to leave it empty.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ Updated backend validation in `/app/backend/src/validations/purchaseBill.js` to allow empty billNumber
2. ✅ Updated backend controller to auto-generate billNumber if not provided (format: PUR-XXXXXXXX)
3. ✅ Removed asterisk (*) from Bill Number label in frontend UI
4. ✅ Removed frontend validation requiring billNumber
5. ✅ "CREATE PURCHASE BILL" button now enabled without billNumber

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/backend/src/validations/purchaseBill.js` - Changed `billNumber: Joi.string().trim().required()` to `billNumber: Joi.string().trim().allow('').optional()`
- `/app/backend/src/controller/purchaseBill.js` - Added conditional auto-generation of billNumber
- `/app/frontend/src/components/admin/suppliers/list.jsx` - Removed required indicator and validation from UI

**Test Results:** Backend validation tested - PASSED (empty bill numbers accepted)

---

## Critical Updates (February 10, 2026)

### P0 RESOLVED: Sales Total Discrepancy Fix
**Issue:** "Today's Sales" total on Day Start page was showing incorrect values because totalSales included ALL orders (paid + unpaid) instead of only PAID orders.

**Root Cause:** The `recordOrderCreated()` function in dailySummary.js was adding ALL order totals to `totalSales` regardless of payment status.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ Modified `recordOrderCreated()` to only add to totalSales when order.paymentStatus === 'paid'
2. ✅ Modified `recordOrderDeleted()` to only subtract from totalSales when order was PAID
3. ✅ Added new `recordPaymentStatusChange()` function to handle status toggle updates
4. ✅ Updated `togglePaymentStatus()` in order controller to call the new function
5. ✅ Updated `recalculateSummary()` to only include paid orders
6. ✅ Fixed frontend DayStart.jsx to properly convert API string values to numbers
7. ✅ Created SQL migration script for users to fix historical data

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/backend/src/services/dailySummary.js` - recordOrderCreated(), recordOrderDeleted(), recordPaymentStatusChange(), recalculateSummary()
- `/app/backend/src/controller/order.js` - togglePaymentStatus()
- `/app/frontend/src/components/admin/dayStart/DayStart.jsx` - Fixed Number() conversions

**Files Created:**
- `/app/backend/migrations/fix_daily_summary_totals.sql` - SQL script for users to fix historical data

**Test Results:** All 8 test cases PASSED (see /app/test_reports/iteration_8.json)

---

## Critical Updates (February 8, 2026)

### P0 RESOLVED: Database Persistence
**Issue:** PostgreSQL data was lost on every pod restart because data was stored on ephemeral overlay filesystem.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ Migrated PostgreSQL data directory to `/app/pgdata` (persistent NVMe volume)
2. ✅ Created initialization scripts for automatic recovery
3. ✅ Implemented backup/restore infrastructure
4. ✅ Crash simulation test passed - 100% data recovery

**Files Created:**
- `/app/backend/scripts/setup_postgres_persistent.sh` - Initial setup
- `/app/backend/scripts/init_postgres.sh` - Pod startup script
- `/app/backend/scripts/backup_postgres.sh` - Backup utility
- `/app/backend/scripts/restore_postgres.sh` - Restore utility
- `/app/backend/scripts/postgres_health.sh` - Health check
- `/app/backend/scripts/crash_simulation_test.sh` - Crash test
- `/app/backend/k8s/deployment.yaml` - Kubernetes reference
- `/app/backend/docs/DATABASE_PERSISTENCE.md` - Full documentation

### Financial Integrity Audit (February 8, 2026)
**All 5 production-level tests PASSED:**
| Test | Status |
|------|--------|
| Concurrency (100 simultaneous) | ✅ PASSED |
| Mutation (Edit/Delete/Void/Refund) | ✅ PASSED |
| Persistence (Crash survival) | ✅ PASSED |
| Numeric Precision (DECIMAL columns) | ✅ PASSED |
| Scale (10,000 invoices) | ✅ PASSED |

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Converted all monetary columns from DOUBLE PRECISION → DECIMAL(15,2)
2. Created Money utility module for fixed-decimal arithmetic
3. Fixed Sequelize DECIMAL string handling

**Files Created:**
- `/app/backend/src/utils/money.js` - Currency utility module
- `/app/backend/migrations/fix_decimal_columns.js` - Schema migration
- `/app/backend/tests/financial_audit.js` - Full audit suite
- `/app/backend/tests/FINANCIAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Detailed report

## Recent Changes (January 30, 2026)

### Bug Fix: Product Selection for Weighted Products
**Issue:** Products were not being added to the invoice after pressing `=` key. Weighted products would disappear immediately after selection.

**Root Cause:** When selecting a weighted product, the code immediately attempted to fetch weight from the RS232 scale. Without a physical scale connected, this always failed and reset the entire form, making it impossible to even have a product selected.

**Fix Applied:** Removed auto-fetch weight on product selection in `frontend/src/components/admin/orders/create.jsx` (line 803-813). Now:
1. User selects a weighted product → stays selected
2. Price auto-fills from product database
3. User can modify price if needed
4. User presses `=` to fetch weight from scale and add product
5. If scale not connected, clear error message is shown

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/admin/orders/create.jsx` - Removed auto-weight-fetch on product selection
